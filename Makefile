# These are targets defined for the makefile.
# Simply typing "make" in the terminal will
# just run the first target, so in this case
# it's equivalent to "make all". These targets
# are just sequences of terminal commands that
# allow for more streamlined compiling - it's
# convenient to just type "make all".
#
# The basic syntax for a target looks like this:
# <target name>: <dependencies>
#	<commands>
# The dependencies must be other targets, which
# are run in the order they appear when this target
# is invoked. If a dependency is already up to date,
# (i.e., the files it creates already exist,) then
# it is skipped. Then, the commands (which must 
# have a tab-length space in front of them) 
# are run in order.

# This target will be run for your final submission.

# By default, targets are file names.
# If a file with the name of the target exists,
# then make will assume that no more changes 
# need to be made to the file, and it will 
# simply print a message saying "already up to date".
# So for example, if we have a file named "all"
# created, then "make all" would fail even though
# that's not what we want. Declaring it as a
# "phony" target tells make that we don't care about
# the file "all" and allows it to work even if
# the file already exists.
